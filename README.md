# Lending-Club

A consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers wants to know the driving factors that can identify how likely a person will default or not.

The data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

**Using EDA** understand how the consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. The company can utilize  this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
